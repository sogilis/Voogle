# ADR-001-Back-end-language

* Creation Date: 05/01/2022
* Status: Approved

## Context

In order to write the first bricks of the Voogle application, we need to choose a language that suites our needs.
We already have identified some languages, NodeJS, Go and Java Quarkus.

The chosen language must be suited to write Cloud Native application.

## Decision

We chose to use Go since several members of our team already use it and it suits our needs.

## Options

### 1. NodeJS

*"Node.js has an event-driven architecture capable of asynchronous I/O. These design choices aim to optimize throughput and scalability in web applications with many input/output operations"*
 [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node.js)

#### Benefits
* NodeJS is one of the most popular language
* Rich Ecosystem, there are many package available and almost all the topics are covered
* NodeJS is rather performant
* JavaScript is a language that allow to develop quickly
* NodeJS's applications start quickly

#### Drawbacks
* Heavy treatment can impact performances
* If not used properly, it can the event programming paradigm can have bad consequences performance wise
* Requires the interpreter to be installed
* The Async system can be hard to maintain


#### Points of attention
* Typescript is superset of NodeJS that allows to have a strongly typed language on top of Javascript. It allows us to catch a lot of mistakes that can be 
  make with JavaScript. Plus Typescript is transpiled to native JavaScript.

### Go

*"Go is a statically typed, compiled programming language designed at Google by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson. Go is syntactically similar to C, but with memory safety, garbage collection, structural typing, and CSP-style concurrency. The language is often referred to as Golang because of its former domain name, golang.org, but the proper name is Go."*
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(programming_language))

#### Benefits
* Open-source
* Static typing
* Easy to learn, easy to use and top productivity
* High level of efficiency
* Advanced performance for networking and full use of multicore power
* Simplicity and speed: compiled in machine language, very small binary
* GoDoc code documentation
* Glint code linter
* Gofmt code formatting
* Easy to integrate into a env
* Package systems: simple dependency management clear code separation
* Multithreading and concurrency: goroutines
* Integrated testing framework
* Compilation multiplatform

#### Drawbacks

* Golang file size larger than competing programming languages
* Error handling: errors â†’ value
* No runtime security, especially at compile time
* No graphical library
* No manual memory management
* Young language 8 years old

#### Points of attention

### Java Quarkus
Quarkus is a Java Framework that was conceived for Cloud application. It aims to be lighter and quicker to start that standard Java application (especially 
when using the Native build).

#### Benefits
* Quick boot time (99% less than traditional Java app)
* Smaller memory footprint (86% less than traditional Java app)
* Can be compiled into a native application (Without JVM)
* Live reload is supported
* Reactive and imperative development paradigm (At the same time)

#### Drawbacks
* Much longer build (10x longer)
* With native build, some Java features (like reflections) are not available
* Some incompatibilities with some major libraries (like Spring boot (partially))
* Some pre-configurations already done by default
