## Context

As part of the development of the Voogle application we have to choose a framework.

## Options

### Option 1: VueJs

#### Benefits

* Simple approach: javascript and html
* Data binding
* Bidirectional communication architecture: MVVM and Virtual DOM
* Detailed and complete documentation
* FlexibilitÃ©: run with browser
* Simple integration: integration with existing. No need to start form scratch
* Small size: framework very small 18-21 Ko and faster than Angular.JS and React.JS and Ember.JS.
* Versatility in terms of application size: Vue companion libraries are officially supported and are kept up-to-date with the main library while Redux is an unofficial react extension (redux -> vuex)
