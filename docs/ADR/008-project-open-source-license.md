# ADR-008-open-source-license

- Creation Date: 01/02/2022
- Status: Approved

## Context

The voogle project is a demonstrator for squarscale. The software is not intended to be commercialized. We decided that the software would be open source. We must choose the best license for our use

## Decision

We will use the option 1 with a AGPL license.

## Options

### 1. AGPL

The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license published by the Free Software Foundation in November 2007, and based on the GNU General Public License, version 3 and the Affero General Public License.

The Free Software Foundation has recommended that the GNU AGPLv3 be considered for any software that will commonly be run over a network. The Free Software Foundation explains the need for the license in the case when a free program is run on a server [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Affero_General_Public_License)

#### Benefits

- Access to the source code
- Right to use
- Right to duplicate
- Right to extract components
- Right to modify
- Obligation for the user to give access to the source code of the derived or composed software not distributed
- Obligation to quote
- Possibility to choose another license for external modules created for the software
- No possibility to relicense all or part of the unmodified software
- No possibility to choose another license for the software derived from the software
- Possibility for the software to be linked or combined with components distributed under another license (component system logic) under the GNU GPL v3
- Open Source OSI validation

#### Drawbacks

### 2. GPL

The GNU General Public License (GNU GPL or simply GPL) is a series of widely used free software licenses that guarantee end users the four freedoms to run, study, share, and modify the software. The licenses were originally written by Richard Stallman, founder of the Free Software Foundation (FSF), for the GNU Project, and grant the recipients of a computer program the rights of the Free Software Definition. The GPL series are all copyleft licenses, which means that any derivative work must be distributed under the same or equivalent license terms. This is in distinction to permissive software licenses, of which the BSD licenses and the MIT License are widely used, less restrictive examples. GPL was the first copyleft license for general use.
