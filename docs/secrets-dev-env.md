# Secrets Handling

To not commit the devs password in Git, we use an env file [https://docs.docker.com/compose/environment-variables/#the-env-file](https://docs.docker.com/compose/environment-variables/#the-env-file).

Please ask the other dev to share their .env file with you or rename the `.env.template` file and file the gaps.
